# Changelog V6.2

## Version 6.2 - Edit Convocation Bug Fixes
**Date**: 2024

### Bug Fixes
- 🐛 **Fixed coach (mister) pre-selection**: Coaches previously associated with the convocation are now properly loaded and pre-selected in both mister dropdowns
- 🐛 **Ensured player pre-selection**: Players previously called are correctly shown as selected in the form (verification and cleanup of existing logic)

### Technical Changes
- Reordered function calls in `loadConvocation()`:
  - Now calls `loadCoaches()` BEFORE `prefillForm()` to ensure dropdown options exist before setting values
  - This fixes the timing issue where coach selection was attempted before options were populated
- Removed unnecessary `setTimeout()` wrappers from mister value setting in `prefillForm()`
- Added validation to skip setting mister values if they are 'N/D'

### Files Changed
```
M edit_convocation.html (function call order and logic fixes)
M manifest.json (version update to V6.2)
+ CHANGELOG_V6.2.md (this file)
```

### Code Changes Detail

#### Before (V6.1)
```javascript
// In loadConvocation():
prefillForm(originalConvocation);
loadCoaches();
loadPlayers();

// In prefillForm():
if (convocation.details.misterPartita) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        misterPartitaSelect.value = convocation.details.misterPartita;
    }, 100);
}
```

#### After (V6.2)
```javascript
// In loadConvocation():
loadCoaches();
prefillForm(originalConvocation);
loadPlayers();

// In prefillForm():
if (convocation.details.misterPartita && convocation.details.misterPartita !== 'N/D') {
    misterPartitaSelect.value = convocation.details.misterPartita;
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Coaches are now correctly pre-selected when editing convocations
- ✅ Players remain correctly pre-selected (existing logic verified)
- ✅ Form is fully pre-populated with all previous data
- ✅ No breaking changes - fully backward compatible
- ✅ No database changes required

## Migration Notes
No migration needed. Simply update the files and the fix is active.
