# Changelog - Version 6.3 Update

## Summary
Updated the Area Polis2013 button label from "Risultati" to "Area Polis2013" in index.html as requested.

## Problem
The Area Polis2013 button was displaying "Risultati" as its label instead of "Area Polis2013", which was inconsistent with the documented feature name and could cause confusion for users.

## Solution

### Changes Made (Minimal - 3 lines total)

**1. Button Label (line 274)**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<button id="area-polis2013-button" class="...">
    Risultati
</button>

<!-- After -->
<button id="area-polis2013-button" class="...">
    Area Polis2013
</button>
```

**2. Version Display (line 227)**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<span class="...">V 6.2</span>

<!-- After -->
<span class="...">V 6.3</span>
```

**3. Version Comment (line 2)**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<!-- Version: 2024-01-22 - V6.2: Area Polis2013 button visible to all users (guests included), opens without pre-filled access code -->

<!-- After -->
<!-- Version: 2024-01-22 - V6.3: Area Polis2013 button label corrected, visible to all users (guests included), opens without pre-filled access code -->
```

## Verified Behavior

✅ **Button Structure**: Button remains in its own container `#area-polis2013-container`, outside `#admin-buttons` div

✅ **Button Position**: Positioned correctly after `#campionato-container` and before `#admin-buttons`

✅ **Click Handler**: Opens https://marcoc82.github.io/polis2013/ in new tab WITHOUT pre-filled access code
```javascript
const url = 'https://marcoc82.github.io/polis2013/';
window.open(url, '_blank');
```

✅ **Visibility Logic**: Shows button to ALL user types (guests and authenticated) for specific companies:
- POLIS
- POLIS PIEVE 2010
- PIEVE2010

✅ **User Experience**: 
- Guest users see the button (if company matches)
- Authenticated users see the button (if company matches)
- Button is yellow (`bg-yellow-400`) for visibility
- Opens in new tab when clicked
- No pre-filled access code - users manually enter their code

## Benefits

✅ **Clear Labeling**: Button now clearly identifies as "Area Polis2013"
✅ **Consistency**: Matches documentation and feature name
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
✅ **Minimal Changes**: Only 3 lines modified (surgical precision)
