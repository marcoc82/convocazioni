# Changelog V6.4

## Version 6.4 - Fix Navigation from Edit Convocation to History View & Mister Loading
**Date**: December 2024

### Summary
This release fixes two critical issues:
1. Users were redirected to the login screen instead of the history view after editing or canceling a convocation from the history screen
2. Mister (coach) loading order ensured that dropdown options are loaded before setting selected values

The solution implements hash-based navigation and sessionStorage to maintain application state, and ensures proper loading sequence for form pre-population.

### Problem Statement
When a user:
1. Opens the history view (Storico Convocazioni)
2. Clicks "Modifica" (Edit) on a convocation
3. Edits the convocation and clicks "Annulla" (Cancel) or "Salva" (Save)
4. The page redirected to `index.html` without any state
5. This caused the application to show the login screen instead of returning to the history view

Additionally, there was a timing issue where:
- Mister (coach) selections were not properly pre-selected in the edit form
- This was due to attempting to set dropdown values before the options were populated
- The fix ensures `loadCoaches()` is called BEFORE `prefillForm()` to guarantee options exist

### Solution Implementation

#### 1. Modified `edit_convocation.html` - goBack() Function
**Location**: Line 193-196

**Before:**
```javascript
function goBack() {
    window.location.href = `index.html`;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function goBack() {
    // Store return flag in sessionStorage to indicate we should show history view
    sessionStorage.setItem('returnToHistory', 'true');
    window.location.href = `index.html#history`;
}
```

**Changes:**
- Added sessionStorage flag to indicate return to history
- Added hash anchor `#history` to the URL
- This function is called both when clicking "Annulla" (Cancel) and after successful save

#### 2. Modified `index.html` - Edit Button Event Handler
**Location**: Line 2714-2727

**Changes:**
- Store application state in sessionStorage before navigating to edit page:
  - `editOrigin`: Set to 'history' to track where the edit was initiated
  - `editCompanyDocId`: Current company document ID
  - `editUserRole`: Current user role (mister/dirigente)
  - `editAppId`: Current application ID

```javascript
// Store state in sessionStorage to restore history view after editing
sessionStorage.setItem('editOrigin', 'history');
sessionStorage.setItem('editCompanyDocId', currentCompanyDocumentId);
sessionStorage.setItem('editUserRole', userRole);
sessionStorage.setItem('editAppId', currentAppId);
```

#### 3. Added Hash Navigation Handler in `index.html`
**Location**: Line 6830-6877

**New Function: `checkHashNavigation()`**
- Checks for hash `#history` in the URL
- Verifies the `returnToHistory` flag in sessionStorage
- Restores application state from sessionStorage:
  - Sets `currentCompanyDocumentId`
  - Sets `userRole`
  - Sets `currentAppId`
- Hides all views and shows the history view
- Loads history convocations data
- Cleans up sessionStorage and URL hash

**Integration:**
- Called on DOMContentLoaded (initial page load)
- Added hashchange event listener for dynamic hash changes
- Ensures proper cleanup of sessionStorage after state restoration

#### 4. Verified Mister Loading Order in `edit_convocation.html`
**Location**: Lines 226-229

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Load coaches first, then pre-fill the form
loadCoaches();
prefillForm(originalConvocation);
loadPlayers();
```

**Key Points:**
- `loadCoaches()` is called FIRST (line 227) to populate dropdown options
- `prefillForm()` is called SECOND (line 228) to set selected values
- This ensures dropdown options exist before attempting to set the selected value
- If saved mister value is 'N/D' or not in the list, the dropdown remains at default "Seleziona mister"
- No setTimeout workarounds needed - fully synchronous execution

**Validation in prefillForm() (lines 246-251):**
```javascript
// Set mister selections if available (coaches already loaded)
if (convocation.details.misterPartita && convocation.details.misterPartita !== 'N/D') {
    misterPartitaSelect.value = convocation.details.misterPartita;
}
if (convocation.details.misterTipo && convocation.details.misterTipo !== 'N/D') {
    misterTipoSelect.value = convocation.details.misterTipo;
}
```

### Technical Details

#### SessionStorage Keys Used:
- `returnToHistory`: Boolean flag indicating return from edit page
- `editOrigin`: Tracks where edit was initiated from
- `editCompanyDocId`: Company document ID to restore
- `editUserRole`: User role to restore
- `editAppId`: Application ID to restore

#### Navigation Flow:
1. **History View → Edit Page:**
   - User clicks "Modifica" button
   - State saved to sessionStorage
   - Navigate to `edit_convocation.html` with query parameters

2. **Edit Page → History View:**
   - User clicks "Annulla" or saves successfully
   - `returnToHistory` flag set in sessionStorage
   - Navigate to `index.html#history`
   - Hash detected on page load
   - State restored from sessionStorage
   - History view displayed
   - SessionStorage cleaned up

### Benefits
- ✅ Maintains user authentication state
- ✅ Returns to history view after edit/cancel
- ✅ No forced login after modification
- ✅ Seamless user experience
- ✅ Uses browser-native features (hash, sessionStorage)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of temporary state
- ✅ Works with both "Annulla" and "Salva" actions
- ✅ Mister selections properly pre-loaded in edit form
- ✅ Synchronous loading order prevents timing issues
- ✅ Handles 'N/D' values gracefully (leaves at default)

### Testing Recommendations
1. Open application and login
2. Navigate to "Storico Convocazioni"
3. Click "Modifica" on any convocation
4. **Verify mister dropdowns show previously selected coaches**
5. Click "Annulla" - should return to history view
6. Click "Modifica" again
7. Make changes and click "Salva Modifiche" - should return to history view after success message
8. Verify no login screen is shown in either case
9. Verify history data is properly loaded and displayed
10. **Test editing a convocation with 'N/D' mister values - should show default dropdown**

### Files Modified
- `edit_convocation.html`: Modified goBack() function; verified mister loading order
- `index.html`: Added sessionStorage state management and hash navigation handler
- `manifest.json`: Updated version to V6.4
- `CHANGELOG_V6.4.md`: Updated with comprehensive documentation

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Works with all existing user roles (mister, dirigente, marco)
- ✅ Compatible with guest user mode (guest users cannot edit)
- ✅ No database schema changes required
- ✅ No forced re-login or session loss
