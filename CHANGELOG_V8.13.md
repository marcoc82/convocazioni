## 🔧 Technical Details

### Auto-Format Implementation
```javascript
formationInput.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
    let value = e.target.value.replace(/[^0-9]/g, '');
    if (value.length > 0) {
        value = value.split('').join('-');
    }
    e.target.value = value;
});
```

### Demo Mode Implementation
```javascript
let demoMode = !window.db;
const DEMO_PLAYERS = ['Mario Rossi', 'Luca Bianchi', ...];

async function getAvailablePlayers() {
    if (demoMode) {
        return DEMO_PLAYERS;
    } else {
        // Load from Firebase
    }
}
```

### Improved Positioning Algorithm
```javascript
const numLines = formation.length;
let yPosition = numLines === 2 ? 70 : numLines === 3 ? 65 : 60;
const yStep = (yPosition - 15) / numLines;
```
