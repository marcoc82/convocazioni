# CHANGELOG V8.14

## Version 8.14 - Enhanced Tactical Positioning & Player List Fix

**Release Date**: 2024
**Type**: Feature Enhancement + Bug Fix

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 8.14 introduces significant improvements to the Tactics page player positioning and fixes a critical bug where the player list would appear empty when clicking on a player position on the field.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Enhanced Player Positioning on Tactical Field

Players are now positioned more realistically according to their roles:

#### ⚡ Attackers (A)
- **Position**: Y=20-25% (was ~45%)
- **Change**: Moved significantly forward into the attacking zone
- **Impact**: More realistic tactical representation

#### 🛡️ Defenders (D)
- **Position**: Y=75% (was ~65%)
- **Change**: Moved further back near the goalkeeper
- **Impact**: Better defensive zone visualization

#### 🎯 Midfielders (C)
- **Position**: Y=50% (center)
- **Horizontal Spacing**: 85% (was 80%)
- **Change**: Wider horizontal distribution
- **Impact**: Better field coverage representation

#### 🥅 Goalkeeper (GK)
- **Position**: Y=92%, X=50% (unchanged)
- Remains at the bottom center of the field

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Empty Player List in Tactics Page

**Issue**: When clicking on a player position on the tactical field, the player selection modal would show an empty list.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect Firestore collection path in `getAvailablePlayers()` function.

**Solution**:
- ❌ **Before**: `collection(db, 'companies', id, 'players')`
- ✅ **After**: `collection(db, 'societa', id, 'giocatori')`

**Additional Improvements**:
- Added proper field name handling (`name` or `nome`)
- Added fallback to document ID if name fields are missing
- Implemented comprehensive error logging
- Added validation for `currentCompanyDocumentId`

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Modified Functions

#### `generateField(formation)`
Complete rewrite with role-based positioning:
```javascript
// Old approach: Sequential Y positioning
yPosition -= yStep;

// New approach: Role-based positioning
if (lineIndex === 0) {
    yPosition = 75;  // Defenders
} else if (lineIndex === 1) {
    yPosition = 50;  // Midfielders (wider: 85%)
} else {
    yPosition = 20;  // Attackers
}
```

#### `getAvailablePlayers()`
Fixed Firestore path and added robust error handling:
```javascript
// V8.14: Fixed to use correct Firestore path
const playersCollectionRef = window.collection(
    window.db, 
    "societa", 
    currentCompanyDocumentId, 
    "giocatori"
);

// Proper field handling
const playerName = playerData.name || playerData.nome || doc.id;
```
