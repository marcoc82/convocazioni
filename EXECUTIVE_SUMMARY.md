# Executive Summary - Edit Convocation Fix V6.2

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: When editing a convocation from history, coaches and players were not pre-selected in the form, forcing users to manually re-enter all data.

**Solution**: Fixed function execution order - now coaches are loaded BEFORE attempting to set their values.

**Impact**: Users can now see and modify existing convocations efficiently without re-entering data.

## Technical Solution (Non-Technical Version)

Think of it like building furniture:
1. ❌ **Wrong way**: Try to put the shelf in the bookcase before building the bookcase → Fails
2. ✅ **Right way**: Build the bookcase first, THEN add the shelf → Works perfectly

In code:
1. ❌ **Wrong way**: Set dropdown values before creating dropdown options → Fails
2. ✅ **Right way**: Create dropdown options first, THEN set values → Works perfectly
