## What's in V6.2?

**One sentence**: Fixed the bug where coaches and players weren't pre-selected when editing convocations.

**One paragraph**: When users clicked "Modifica" to edit a convocation, the form opened with empty coach dropdowns and no players selected, forcing manual re-entry. V6.2 fixes this by reordering function calls so dropdown options are created BEFORE values are set. Now everything is properly pre-selected.

## Common Questions

### Q: What was broken?
**A**: When editing a convocation, coaches weren't pre-selected in dropdowns and players appeared unselected.

### Q: What's fixed now?
**A**: Both coaches and players are now correctly pre-selected, showing exactly what was previously saved.

### Q: How was it fixed?
**A**: Reordered function calls so dropdown options are created before setting their values.

### Q: Is it safe to deploy?
**A**: Yes! All tests passed, no breaking changes, easy rollback if needed.

### Q: Do I need to update the database?
**A**: No! This is a pure client-side fix. No database changes.

### Q: How long does deployment take?
**A**: About 5 minutes to replace files and test.

### Q: Can I rollback if needed?
**A**: Yes, easily. Just restore V6.1 files and refresh browser.

### Q: Will this break anything else?
**A**: No. Changes are surgical and only affect the edit form pre-selection.
