# V6.3 Final - Edit Convocation Pre-selection Fix

## Quick Summary

Fixed the bug where coaches (mister) and players were not pre-selected when editing a convocation from history (storico).

## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** When clicking "Modifica" on a convocation, the edit form would load but:
- Coach dropdowns were empty (no pre-selection)
- Players were not highlighted as selected

**Root Cause:** A redundant `setTimeout` workaround was checking for Firebase readiness, but since the code was already inside an authenticated callback, this check was unnecessary and potentially causing timing issues.

**Solution:** Removed the setTimeout workaround and verified the synchronous execution order.

## Technical Changes

### File: `edit_convocation.html`

**Removed (lines 199-202):**
```javascript
if (!window.db || !window.auth.currentUser) {
    setTimeout(loadConvocation, 500);
    return;
}
```

**Added (lines 199-200):**
```javascript
// Firebase is guaranteed to be ready since this is called from signInAnonymously().then()
// No setTimeout needed - synchronous logic
```

### Verified Execution Order

The correct order is maintained (lines 225-227):
1. `loadCoaches()` - Populates dropdown options
2. `prefillForm()` - Sets selected values  
3. `loadPlayers()` - Renders with visual selection

## Testing

Run the automated tests:
1. Open `test_edit_form_verification.html` in a browser
2. All 6 tests should pass:
   - ✅ Load Coaches Function
   - ✅ Pre-select Coaches (Mister)
   - ✅ Pre-select Players (Set)
   - ✅ Visual Player Selection
   - ✅ Form Data Editability
   - ✅ N/D Value Handling

Manual testing:
1. Open the app and navigate to storico
2. Click "Modifica" on any convocation
3. Verify coaches are pre-selected in both dropdowns
4. Verify players are highlighted in blue
5. Make changes and save
6. Reload and verify changes persisted
