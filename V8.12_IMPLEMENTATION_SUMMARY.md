    return;
}
```

```javascript
// Handles 2-line (D-A) and 3-line (D-C-A) formations
if (formation.length === 2) {
    // 2-line formation: defenders and forwards
    positionLabel = lineIndex === 0 ? 'D' : 'A';
    positionName = lineIndex === 0 ? 'Difensore' : 'Attaccante';
} else {
    // 3-line formation: defenders, midfielders, forwards
    positionLabel = lineIndex === 0 ? 'D' : lineIndex === 1 ? 'C' : 'A';
    positionName = lineIndex === 0 ? 'Difensore' : lineIndex === 1 ? 'Centrocampista' : 'Attaccante';
}
```
