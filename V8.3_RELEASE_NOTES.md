# V8.3 Release Notes

## 🎯 Overview
Version 8.3 introduces three major improvements to the Allenamenti (Training) management system:
1. **Firebase Path Update**: Changed storage path from `companies/` to `societa/`
2. **Collapsible Training Cards**: Cards now collapse to show only the date, expanding on click
3. **Weekly Filter**: Added "Settimana corrente" (Current week) option to period filter

## 🚀 What's New

### 1. Firebase Storage Path Change
Training sessions are now stored at the new path structure:
```
societa/{companyId}/trainingSessions/{sessionId}
```

This aligns with the Italian terminology used throughout the application.

**Impact**: Existing training data stored under `companies/` will need migration. See Migration section below.

### 2. Collapsible Training Cards
Each training session card can now be collapsed/expanded:

**Collapsed State (Default)**:
- Shows only the training date (e.g., "giovedì 19 dicembre 2024")
- Displays expand icon
- Takes minimal vertical space

**Expanded State**:
- Shows full training details
- Player list with attendance checkboxes
- Present/absent counters
- Action buttons (Mark all present/absent, Save)

**How to Use**: Click anywhere on the date header to toggle between collapsed and expanded states.

### 3. Weekly Period Filter
The report period filter now includes a new "Settimana corrente" option:
- **Tutti i periodi** (All periods)
- **Settimana corrente** (Current week) ⭐ NEW
- **Mese corrente** (Current month)
- **Anno corrente** (Current year)

The weekly filter shows only training sessions from Monday through Sunday of the current week.

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Data
If you have training sessions stored under the old `companies/` path:

**Option 1: Migrate Data**
1. Export existing data from `companies/{companyId}/trainingSessions`
2. Import into `societa/{companyId}/trainingSessions`

**Option 2: Revert Path (Not Recommended)**
If you prefer to keep the old path, change all occurrences of:
```javascript
`societa/${currentCompanyDocumentId}/trainingSessions`
```
back to:
```javascript
`companies/${currentCompanyDocumentId}/trainingSessions`
```

### For New Installations
No action needed - the application will automatically use the new `societa/` path.

## 📱 User Experience

### Benefits
- **Cleaner Interface**: Collapsed cards reduce visual clutter
- **Faster Navigation**: Scan training dates quickly without scrolling through details
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Reduced scrolling on mobile devices
- **More Flexible Filtering**: Weekly filter helps coaches focus on immediate schedule

### UI Behavior
- Cards start collapsed by default for a clean initial view
- Click any card's date header to expand and view/edit details
- Click again to collapse the card
- The expand/collapse state is not preserved between page loads

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Data Migration Required**: Existing training data under `companies/` path will not appear
2. **No Animation**: Collapse/expand happens instantly (no smooth animation)
3. **State Not Persisted**: Card expanded/collapsed state resets on page reload
4. **Week Start**: Week always starts on Monday (Italian standard, not configurable)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Smooth slide animation for card collapse/expand
- Remember card states in localStorage
- "Expand All" / "Collapse All" buttons
- Custom date range filter
- Automated data migration tool
- Configurable week start day
