# V9.17 - Spacing Improvements for Tactical Formation View

## 📋 Overview
This version introduces significant spacing improvements to the tactical formation view to ensure that player names and icons from different lines (defenders, midfielders, attackers) do not overlap, improving readability across all formations.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement
1. In the tactical/formation view, ensure that players of different roles (defenders, midfielders, attackers) are not too close together
2. Leave sufficient space between lines and between player icons so that the text below (e.g., name/number) does not overlap with other players' icons/text
3. Improve readability and visual layout of the formation on all views and modules

### After (V9.17)
```
GK: 92%
D:  80% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ (spacing: 95)
    ↓ 18% gap ✓
M:  62% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ (spacing: 120)
    ↓ 21% gap ✓
M:  41% ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ (spacing: 120)

## 📝 Code Changes

### File: `index.html` (generateField function)

```javascript
// BEFORE (V9.16)
if (lineIndex === 0) {
    yPosition = 78;
    xSpacing = 90;
} else if (lineIndex === numLines - 1) {
    yPosition = 15;
    xSpacing = 90;
} else {
    const midfieldStartY = 65;
    const midfieldEndY = 25;
    if (numMidfieldLines === 1) {
        yPosition = 50;
    } else {
        yPosition = midfieldStartY - (midfieldRange * midfieldLineIndex / (numMidfieldLines - 1));
    }
    xSpacing = 115;
}

// AFTER (V9.17)
if (lineIndex === 0) {
    yPosition = 80;  // +2%
    xSpacing = 95;   // +5
} else if (lineIndex === numLines - 1) {
    yPosition = 10;  // -5%
    xSpacing = 95;   // +5
} else {
    const midfieldStartY = 62;  // -3%
    const midfieldEndY = 20;    // -5%
    if (numMidfieldLines === 1) {
        yPosition = 48;  // -2%
    } else {
        yPosition = midfieldStartY - (midfieldRange * midfieldLineIndex / (numMidfieldLines - 1));
    }
    xSpacing = 120;  // +5
}
```

### Console Log Update
```javascript
// Updated from:
console.log(`⚽ V9.16: Field generated with new logic (First=D, Last=A, Middle=C lines)`);

// To:
console.log(`⚽ V9.17: Field generated with improved spacing (D=80%/95%, C=62-20%/120%, A=10%/95%)`);
