# V9.32 - Visual Comparison: Modal Close Behavior

## Before V9.32 (V9.30/V9.31)

### Close Behavior
The modal could be closed in **TWO WAYS:**
1. ✅ Click the X button in top-right corner
2. ✅ Click outside the modal (on the backdrop/background)

### User Experience
- User clicks player name → Modal opens
- User accidentally clicks outside → **Modal closes unexpectedly**
- User clicks X button → Modal closes as expected

### Code
```javascript
// Event listeners for modal
if (closeModalBtn) {
    closeModalBtn.addEventListener('click', closePlayerModal);
}
if (playerModal) {
    playerModal.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
        if (e.target === playerModal) {
            closePlayerModal();  // Closes when clicking backdrop
        }
    });
}
```

### Documentation
> Click outside the modal or the close button to dismiss it

## After V9.32 (Current)

### Close Behavior
The modal can ONLY be closed in **ONE WAY:**
1. ✅ Click the X button in top-right corner
2. ❌ Click outside the modal (REMOVED - no longer closes)

### User Experience
- User clicks player name → Modal opens
- User clicks outside → **Modal stays open** (no accidental closure)
- User clicks X button → Modal closes as expected

### Code
```javascript
// Event listeners for modal
// V9.32: Modal closes ONLY with X button, not by clicking outside
if (closeModalBtn) {
    closeModalBtn.addEventListener('click', closePlayerModal);
}
// Removed: backdrop click listener
```

### Documentation
> Click the X button to close the modal (clicking outside will NOT close it)

### Solution
Remove the backdrop click event listener, keeping only the X button close functionality.

1. **Prevents accidental closure** - User must explicitly click X to close
2. **Better user control** - Clear, intentional action required
3. **Matches user expectations** - Aligns with the original requirement
4. **Simpler code** - Less code to maintain
5. **No side effects** - All other features preserved
