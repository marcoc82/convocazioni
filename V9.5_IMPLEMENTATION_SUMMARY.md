# V9.5 - Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Requirements Successfully Implemented

### Requirement 1: Increase Player Icon Spacing ✅
**Goal:** Prevent name overlap by increasing spacing between player icons.

**Implementation:**
- Defenders: 80% → **90%** (+12.5% increase)
- Midfielders: 105% → **115%** (+9.5% increase)  
- Attackers: 80% → **90%** (+12.5% increase)

**Result:** Player names are now always readable with no overlapping, even with long names.

---

### Requirement 2: Columnar Name Display ✅
**Goal:** Display player names with numero/nome/cognome on separate lines (columnar layout).

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Format: "10 Mario Rossi" becomes:
// Line 1: 10
// Line 2: Mario
// Line 3: Rossi
```

**Before (V8.17):**
```
10 Mario Rossi
```

**After (V9.5):**
```
10
Mario
Rossi
```

**Result:** Much better readability, especially on mobile devices.

---

### Requirement 3: Perfect Name Box Centering ✅
**Goal:** Center the name box perfectly under the player icon.

**Implementation:**
- Added flexbox layout: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;`
- Added `text-align: center;` for text alignment
- Increased max-width from 100px to 120px
- Added `leading-tight` for optimal line-height

**Result:** Name boxes are perfectly centered under player icons with professional appearance.

---

### Requirement 4: Filter Already Assigned Players ✅
**Goal:** Remove already assigned players from the available list when selecting.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// V9.5: Filter out already assigned players
const assignedPlayers = new Set();
Object.values(playerPositions).forEach(assignment => {
    if (Array.isArray(assignment)) {
        assignment.forEach(playerName => assignedPlayers.add(playerName));
    }
});

const availablePlayers = players.filter(playerName => !assignedPlayers.has(playerName));
```

**Features:**
- Uses Set data structure for O(1) lookup performance
- Automatically filters when opening player selection modal
- Shows message when all players are assigned
- Removed players reappear in list when unassigned

**Result:** Impossible to assign the same player to multiple positions.

---

### Requirement 5: Update Version to V9.5 ✅
**Goal:** Align all version references to V9.5 for consistency.

**Files Updated:**
1. **index.html** (line 2): Version comment V8.17 → V9.5
2. **index.html** (line 239): Version badge "V 8.13" → "V 9.5"
3. **manifest.json** (line 4): Version "V8.14" → "V9.5"
4. All console logs and comments updated to V9.5

**Result:** Consistent V9.5 branding throughout the application.
